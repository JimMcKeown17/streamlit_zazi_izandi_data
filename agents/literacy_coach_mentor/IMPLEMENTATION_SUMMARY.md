# Literacy Coach Mentor - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a multi-agent AI coaching system for literacy coaches in the Zazi iZandi programme. The system provides personalized feedback based on actual session data from the TeamPact database.

## What Was Built

### 1. Agent Architecture

**Supervisor Agent** (`supervisor_agent.py`)
- Main orchestrator using GPT-4o
- Routes queries to specialized agents
- Synthesizes insights from multiple sources
- Provides conversational interface

**Specialized Agents** (all using GPT-4o-mini)
- **Session Analysis Agent** (`session_analysis_agent.py`): Analyzes session frequency, pacing, and consistency
- **Differentiation Agent** (`differentiation_agent.py`): Checks if groups are taught at appropriate levels
- **Performance Agent** (`performance_agent.py`): Compares learner performance against benchmarks

### 2. Database Tools (`tools.py`)

Five function tools that query the `teampact_sessions_complete` table:

1. **get_coach_sessions(user_id)** - Fetches all session data for a coach
2. **get_coach_groups(user_id)** - Gets group-level progress information
3. **get_coach_summary_stats(user_id)** - Overall statistics and metrics
4. **get_benchmark_comparison(user_id)** - Performance vs national/programme benchmarks
5. **calculate_letter_progress()** - Helper function to calculate progress through letter sequence

### 3. Prompts & Instructions (`prompts.py`)

Comprehensive agent instructions including:
- Programme context and background
- National and provincial benchmarks
- Zazi iZandi targets and expectations
- Letter sequence (frequency-based order)
- Coaching best practices
- Detailed instructions for each agent

### 4. Streamlit Interface (`new_pages/coach_assistant.py`)

User-friendly web interface featuring:
- Coach authentication via TeamPact user_id
- Chat-based interaction
- Quick action buttons for common queries
- Session state management
- Error handling and debugging support

### 5. Testing & Documentation

- **test_agent.py**: Comprehensive test suite for tools and agents
- **README.md**: Package overview and technical documentation
- **USAGE.md**: User guide with examples and troubleshooting
- **IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md**: This document

## Key Features

### Differentiation Analysis
- Detects if 3+ groups are at the same progress level (red flag)
- Validates groups are progressing through letter sequence appropriately
- Provides guidance on forming level-appropriate groups

### Pacing Analysis
- Calculates letters per session/week
- Compares to expected pace (2 letters per 3 sessions for Grade 1)
- Identifies if coach is moving too fast or too slow
- Accounts for different grades (R, 1, 2)

### Performance Benchmarking
- Compares against Eastern Cape benchmarks (27% reach 40 lpm)
- References national standards (<50% know all letters)
- Uses Zazi iZandi programme targets (53-74% reaching benchmarks)
- Analyzes attendance rates (target >80%)

### Session Frequency Tracking
- Calculates sessions per week
- Identifies gaps in delivery
- Compares to ideal target (3+ sessions/week)
- Tracks consistency over time

## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow
1. Coach enters user_id in Streamlit interface
2. User asks question via chat
3. Streamlit enhances prompt with `[Coach User ID: X]` format
4. Supervisor agent extracts user_id from prompt
5. Supervisor routes to appropriate specialized agent(s)
6. Specialized agents call database tools with user_id
7. Tools query `teampact_sessions_complete` table
8. Data is analyzed and returned to agents
9. Supervisor synthesizes insights
10. Response displayed in chat interface

### Letter Progress Calculation
Uses existing logic from `letter_progress_detailed_july_cohort.py`:
- Finds rightmost (highest index) letter taught
- Calculates progress percentage through sequence
- Tracks progress per group over time
- Detects grade from group names

### Database Schema Used
From `teampact_sessions_complete` table:
- `user_id`, `user_name` - Coach identification
- `class_name` - Group identifier
- `program_name` - School name
- `session_started_at` - Session timestamp
- `letters_taught` - Comma-separated letters
- `attended_percentage` - Attendance rate
- `participant_total` - Group size
- `session_text` - Coach notes

## Benchmarks & Targets

### Hardcoded in System
- **Eastern Cape**: 27% reach 40 lpm (Grade 1)
- **National**: <50% know all letters (Grade 1)
- **Zazi iZandi 2023**: 74% reaching benchmarks
- **Zazi iZandi 2024**: 53% reaching benchmarks
- **Expected Pace**: 2 letters per 3 sessions (Grade 1)
- **Attendance Target**: >80%
- **Session Frequency**: 3+ per week ideal

### Letter Sequence
Frequency-based order (26 letters):
```
a, e, i, o, u, b, l, m, k, p, s, h, z, n, d, y, f, w, v, x, g, t, q, r, c, j
```

## How to Use

### For Coaches (Streamlit)
```bash
streamlit run new_pages/coach_assistant.py
```

### For Developers (Programmatic)
```python
from agents.literacy_coach_mentor import create_supervisor_agent
from agents import Runner
import asyncio

async def main():
    supervisor = create_supervisor_agent()
    prompt = "[Coach User ID: 12345] How am I doing overall?"
    result = await Runner.run(supervisor, prompt)
    print(result.final_output)

asyncio.run(main())
```

- `DIFFERENTIATION_INSTRUCTIONS`
- `PERFORMANCE_INSTRUCTIONS`
- `SUPERVISOR_INSTRUCTIONS`

### Database Schema Changes
If `teampact_sessions_complete` schema changes, update queries in `tools.py`.

## Conclusion
