      "\n",
      "### Programme Performance\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Grade 1 Children:\n",
      "- **EGRA Score Improvement**: Increased from **14** to **38**.\n",
      "- **Percentage Reaching Reading Benchmark**: Climbed from **13%** to **53%**.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Interpretation:**\n",
      "- This means that over half of the children reached the reading benchmark, which is a significant achievement compared to the national figure where only 27% of Eastern Cape Grade 1 learners hit the 40 letters per minute benchmark.\n",
      "- The improvement in EGRA scores indicates substantial progress in literacy skills.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Grade R Children:\n",
      "- **EGRA Score Improvement**: Jumped from **1** to **25**.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Interpretation:**\n",
      "- This considerable improvement in the EGRA score shows a strong foundational boost even before entering Grade 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Programme Reach\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2024, the programme:\n",
      "- Was piloted in 16 schools.\n",
      "- Employed 82 youth.\n",
      "- Served 3,490 children.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Narrative Summary\n",
      "The Zazi iZandi programme has made impressive strides in improving literacy among young learners. The percentage of Grade 1 children reaching the reading benchmark more than quadrupled. This suggests that the programme’s targeted approach and support structure are effectively enhancing early literacy skills.\n",
