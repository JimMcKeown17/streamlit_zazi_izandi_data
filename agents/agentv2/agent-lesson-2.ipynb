      "\n",
      "2. **Instruction Method**: The teaching revolves around letter sounds, which are introduced in a frequency-based sequence. This means children learn letters based on how often they appear in the language, making it more efficient for reading development.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Level-Based Groups**: Different groups may work on different letters at any given time. This differentiation ensures that each child's learning needs are met, allowing them to progress at their own pace.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Teacher Assistants (TAs)**: The programme employs Teacher Assistants who facilitate learning sessions and use an official tool called the **Letter Tracker**. This tracker helps in organizing the teaching process according to letter frequency, ensuring that the instruction aligns with language structure.\n",
