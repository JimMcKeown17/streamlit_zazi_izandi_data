She had called them together but only began preparing her materials after doing so, which led to the learners becoming distracted and playing among themselves. Despite this, she managed to regain their attention and begin the session.  Although her session was not perfect, she reviewed and introduced letters that had been taught previously. She then engaged the learners through letter-writing activities, a search-and-find task, and a board game, which helped make the session interactive and enjoyable.
