One observation I made is that Anelisa was not shading on her LKPT and instead was randomly selecting letters to introduce to the learners. I advised her to shade the letters as this helps track which ones have already been introduced.  At the start of her session, the learners were unsettled. She had called them together but only began preparing her materials after doing so, which led to the learners becoming distracted and playing among themselves. Despite this, she managed to regain their attention and begin the session.  Although her session was not perfect, she reviewed and introduced letters that had been taught previously. She then engaged the learners through letter-writing activities, a search-and-find task, and a board game, which helped make the session interactive and enjoyable. She codes her session correct by asking each child to sound out all the letter sound she did."
