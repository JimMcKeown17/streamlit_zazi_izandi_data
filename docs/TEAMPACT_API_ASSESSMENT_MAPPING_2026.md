# TeamPact API Assessment Data Mapping — 2026

**Last Updated:** May 26, 2026

This document describes how 2026 assessment data flows from the TeamPact API into the `assessments_2026` database table, with particular focus on how **Grade**, **Programme Name (program_name)**, and **Class Name (class_name)** are resolved.

---

## Overview

Assessment data is synced nightly via the Django management command:
```bash
python manage.py sync_assessments_2026
```

Located at: `Zazi_iZandi_Website_2025/api/management/commands/sync_assessments_2026.py`

The sync involves **two API calls** that are combined:

1. **Survey Responses** — `GET /surveys/{survey_id}/responses` — fetches all assessment answers
2. **Group Lookup** — `GET /groups/{group_id}` — resolves class_name and program_name from group_id

---

## Survey IDs

| Survey ID | Language / Type | Description |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| **815** | isiXhosa | Baseline Full Assessment - IsiXhosa |
| **816** | Afrikaans | Baseline Full Assessment - Afrikaans 2026 |
| **817** | English | Baseline Full Assessment - English 2026 |
| **805** | ECD | ZZ ECD Baseline 2026 |
| **880** | English | English Midline Full Assessment - 2026 |
| **881** | Afrikaans | Afrikaans Midline Full Assessment - 2026 |
| **882** | isiXhosa | IsiXhosa Midline Full Assessment - 2026 |
| **824** | N/A | Mentor Visits 2026 (separate sync) |

## Two Different Mapping Paths

### Path A: Primary School Surveys (815, 816, 817, 880, 881, 882) — Requires Group Lookup

Primary school survey responses do **NOT** include `class_name` or `program_name` directly. They provide:

| API Response Field | Contains | Example |
|-------------------|----------|---------|
| `participant_id` | Learner ID | `351549` |
| `participant_name` | Learner full name | `"Aqhama Diniso"` |
| `group_id` | JSON string with group/class ID(s) | `"[59979]"` |
| `group_name` | Always null | `null` |
| `user_name` | EA/collector who administered | `"Asemahle Mancayi"` |
| `user_id` | EA user ID | `28764` |

**To get class_name and program_name**, the sync script:

1. Collects all unique `group_id` values from all primary assessment responses
2. Parses each `group_id` from its JSON string format (e.g., `"[59979]"` → `59979`)
3. Calls `GET /groups/{group_id}` for each unique group ID
4. Builds a lookup cache: `{group_id: {name, program_name}}`

#### Group API Response → Field Mapping

```
GET /groups/59979 response:
{
  "data": {
    "name": "Grade 1 - Canzibe Primary School",    ← becomes class_name
    "program_id": 1522,
    "program": {
      "name": "Canzibe Primary School",             ← becomes program_name
    }
  }
}
```

| Database Column | Source | Example |
|----------------|--------|---------|
| `class_name` | `groups/{id}.data.name` | `"Grade 1 - Canzibe Primary School"` |
| `program_name` | `groups/{id}.data.program.name` | `"Canzibe Primary School"` |
| `class_id` | First parsed value from `group_id` | `59979` |
| `grade` | **Derived** from `class_name` via substring matching | `"Grade 1"` |

#### Grade Derivation Logic

Grade is **NOT** a direct API field for primary surveys. It is extracted from `class_name` using this logic (in `extract_grade_from_class_name()`):

```python
if 'Grade R' in class_name:   → 'Grade R'
if 'Grade 1' in class_name:   → 'Grade 1'
if 'Grade 2' in class_name:   → 'Grade 2'
# Fallback: check first token only when it is a grade-like code
'R', 'RA', 'R1' → 'Grade R'
'1', '1A' → 'Grade 1'
'2', '2B' → 'Grade 2'
# Otherwise → '' (empty string)
```

For primary midline surveys, some `group_id` values resolve to letter-group names such as `"Lisenathi September-Letters-Group 5"` or `"Rukaya Weavel-Letters-Group 3(2B)"` rather than a grade class. The sync does **not** infer grade from these assessor-name labels; it falls back to the learner's latest baseline grade using `participant_id`.

#### Participant Name Splitting

The API provides `participant_name` as a single string. The sync splits it:
```python
full_name = "Aqhama Diniso"
first_name = "Aqhama"     # first token
last_name  = "Diniso"     # remainder after first space
```

Gender is **not available** from primary survey responses — stored as empty string.

---

### Path B: ECD Survey (805) — Direct Fields

ECD survey responses **DO** include `class_name` and `program_name` directly in the API response. No group lookup needed.

However, learner identity (name, grade, gender) is in **free-text answers**, not in participant fields:

| Question ID | Maps To | Description |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| 28183 | `first_name` | Learner first name |
| 28184 | `last_name` | Learner last name |
| 28181 | `grade` | Learner grade (free text) |
| 28185 | `gender` | Learner gender |

| Database Column | Source | Notes |
|----------------|--------|-------|
| `class_name` | `response.class_name` | Direct from API |
| `program_name` | `response.program_name` | Direct from API |
| `grade` | Answer to question 28181 | Free-text, may need normalization |
| `first_name` | Answer to question 28183 | Free-text |
| `last_name` | Answer to question 28184 | Free-text |
| `gender` | Answer to question 28185 | Free-text |
| `participant_id` | Not available | Stored as empty string |

---

## Sync Process (3 Phases)

```
Phase 1: Fetch all primary survey responses
  └─ GET /surveys/815/responses?page=1..N  (primary baseline)
  └─ GET /surveys/816/responses?page=1..N
  └─ GET /surveys/817/responses?page=1..N
  └─ GET /surveys/880/responses?page=1..N  (primary midline)
  └─ GET /surveys/881/responses?page=1..N
  └─ GET /surveys/882/responses?page=1..N

Phase 2: Build group cache
  └─ Collect unique group_ids from all primary responses
  └─ GET /groups/{id} for each unique group_id
  └─ Cache: {group_id → {class_name, program_name}}

Phase 3: Flatten & save
  └─ For each primary response:
      └─ Look up class_name + program_name from group cache
      └─ Derive grade from class_name
      └─ Split participant_name → first_name + last_name
      └─ Extract EGRA sub-test scores from answers
      └─ Save to assessments_2026 + assessment_cells_2026
  └─ For ECD (survey 805): fetch, flatten (direct fields), save
```

---

## EGRA Sub-Test Detection

Primary surveys (815/816/817/880/881/882) can have up to 3 EGRA sub-tests per response. The sync determines which sub-test an answer belongs to using:

1. **Question label** (if available): `"letter"` → letters, `"non"/"nonsense"` → nonwords, else → words
2. **Cell count fallback**: If no label, 60 cells → letters (first match only)

## Troubleshooting

### Grade shows as empty
- The `group_id` on the response may not have been resolved (API error or missing group)
- The `class_name` doesn't contain "Grade R", "Grade 1", or "Grade 2"
- Check the sync log for group cache build errors

### program_name or class_name is empty
- The response's `group_id` field was null or empty
- The group API returned an error for that group_id
- For ECD: the response didn't include `program_name`/`class_name` fields

### Duplicate or missing assessments
- Sync skips responses whose `response_id` already exists in the database
- Use `--full-refresh` to delete and re-sync all records for selected surveys
- Check `data_refresh_timestamp` to see when each record was last synced

### Data not appearing on dashboard
- Streamlit pages cache data for 1 hour (`ttl=3600`). Clear cache or wait.
- Check that the sync ran: `SELECT MAX(data_refresh_timestamp) FROM assessments_2026;`
