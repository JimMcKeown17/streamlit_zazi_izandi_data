# Implementation Plan for 2025 Session Analysis Page

1. Add new page handler file `pages_nav/page_2025_sessions.py` that renders Session Analysis using existing `db_api_get_sessions` module. Done - New file created with `show()` implementing UI and data logic.

2. Update `Home.py` navigation to include the new Session Analysis page under "2025 Results" section. Done - Added import and st.Page entry.

3. Create new page handler file `pages_nav/page_2025_zazai.py` that contains AI analysis chatbot separated from midline page. Done - Implemented dedicated ZazAI page replicating the full AI analysis functionality.

4. Update `Home.py` navigation to include new 'ZazAI' page under "2025 Results" section. Done - Added import and page entry for ZazAI with robot icon.

5. Remove AI Analysis section from `pages_nav/page_2025_midline.py`. Done - Replaced section with informational note pointing users to the ZazAI page.
