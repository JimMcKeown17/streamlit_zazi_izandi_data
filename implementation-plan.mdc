# Implementation Plan for 2025 Session Analysis Page

1. Add new page handler file `pages_nav/page_2025_sessions.py` that renders Session Analysis using existing `db_api_get_sessions` module. Done - New file created with `show()` implementing UI and data logic.

2. Update `Home.py` navigation to include the new Session Analysis page under "2025 Results" section. Done - Added import and st.Page entry.
